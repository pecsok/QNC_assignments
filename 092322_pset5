Do a post-hoc power analysis to determine the number of data samples needed to achieve 80% power for a series of possible effect sizes. 

Assume that a "data sample" is simply the non-parametric correlation coefficient between pupil diameter and LC activty measured in a given session.

Step 1: 
Obtain a null distribution of these data samples:
Compute the correlation coefficients on simulated data that are independently generated from Poisson (for LC spiking data) 
and Gaussian (for pupil data)distributions.


Step 2:

plot n (number of data samples, corresponding to correlation coefficients measured in a single expermental session) needed for 
80% power as a function of effect sizes.

Step 3: 
Compute power To compute power, you can use TTestIndPower
