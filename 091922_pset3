Binomial problem set. 


Exercise 1

Assume that there are 10 quanta available in a nerve terminal, and for a given release event each is released with a probability of 0.2. 
For one such event, what is the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 quanta will be released?

If there are n available quanta in a presynaptic terminal, and each is released with probability p, then the number of quanta
that are actually released should follow a binomial distribution with parameters n and p.

0: ~.1
1: ~.28
2: ~.3
3: ~1.7
4: ~.1
5: ~.04
6: ~.01
7-10: <.01. 

*Need to troubleshoot to figure out how to print value labels!


Exercise 2:

With 14 quanta and p = 0.1, probability of 8 quanta being released is essentially 0. 
When p = 0.7, the probability of 8 quanta = 0.126
p = .1; 0
p = .2; .001
p = .3; .024
p = .4; .088
p = .5; .172
p = .6; .199
p = .7; .120

Solution: print(f'counts = {normalized_counts}f')


Exercise 3: 
5 quanta
p=0.1
Two experiments? I'm very confused by this question. I will take the probability of 5 quanta from the previous question
as the first experiment. 

p(first exp) = 0
p(second exp) = .007
Total likelihood =.007
Total log-likelihood = -2.15. 

I think I have done something wrong here?

Likelihood function for 5 quanta release with n = 14
p = .1; .007
p = .2; .102
p = .3; .182
p = .4; .192
p = .5; .13
p = .6; .008
p = .7; 0
p = .8,.9: 0

Log-likelihood function for deciles:
p = .1; .007
p = .2; .102
p = .3; .182
p = .4; .192
p = .5; .13
p = .6; .008
p = .7; 0
p = .8,.9: 0

Maximum value: .192
Higher resolution: find true max. p=.35, max is .222
Effect of sample size: Not sure what we mean here. If its number of experiments, fewer will make estimate less accurate

Exercise 4
Based on results above, p =~ 0.4

Exercise 5:
Change temp. 7 quantal events from 14 quanta. compute p 
p = 0.5?
Probability of getting 7 quanta given p stayed at 0.3: 
p = 0.066
With a threshold of 0.05, we cannot conclude that temperature had an effect.
