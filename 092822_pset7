Exercise 1:
geode vs limestone
20 rocks per group
Wanna compare median reaction times - what test to use?

Properties of distributions:
Unpaired samples, not sure what they differ by
Mann-whitney. Common substitute for two sample t test.


Exercise 2:
50 people given vaccine. test whether people aged more after getting a vaccine.
You have a distribution of ages, but this is going to be a paired test
For paired tests, your null is that the median of the difference distribution is zero
Use Wilcoxon, suited for paired samples.


Exercise 3:
Show 40 people produce X, then have the same people see it again when wearing the device.
Do they like it more when they're wearing the device?
Hmm. I would say Wilcoxon because this is a paired sample (same people) and our null hypothesis is that the device 
doesn't do anything, so the median centers on 0.
